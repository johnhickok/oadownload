Python scripts used for downloading CSV's from <a href="https://openaddresses.io/">openaddresses.io</a>

These scripts are very new and there is much work to do.
1. Download a region or individual county or city CSV's. Better off not automating this for now.
2. Extract CSV's. Python is your friend.
3. Iterate through each CSV and create a 'clean' version of the file.
4. Append the clean files into a database table.
5. Convert table for each state to a feature class
6. Create a composite geocode locator for each state's feature class.

This is a work in progress.
